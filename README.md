# mohub-to-dpla

A set of scripts to crawl OAI feeds from MoHub member institutions and convert the data into DPLA-formatted metadata for quarterly ingests.

`python main.py` sets the whole process in motion and creates a line-separated JSON main ingest file as well as reports for each institution.
